#Program #5 - Button with pull-up and pull-down resistor

Hook a button across the gutter.
Connect a wire from 3.3 V to anywhere on the breadboard.
Connect a 10k Ohm resistor to the same row on the breadboard as the wire from 3.3 V.
Connect a wire to the same row as the 10k Ohm resistor and connect the other end of the wire to the same row as the top of the button.
On that same row as the 10k Ohm resistor connect a 330 Ohm resistor and connect the other end to pin 0.
Connect a wire from the same row as the bottom of the button and connect the other end to ground.
