# Install and Setup Software for the Parallax Activity Board

You need to download two files, install one, and then update.

1. [Download the SimpleIDE software](http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/propeller-c/propeller-c-set-simpleide) from the Parallax web site.
2. Locate and double click the SimpleIDE setup file you just download. This will install the
 code editor, compiler, help files, serial console, and FTDI driver (serial console driver) 
 for creating *C language programs*.
During the install process, it will ask you to plug in your Activity Board and turn the board on in order
to complete the installation of the FTDI (serial) driver.
3. After the installer completes, launch the SimpleIDE program and allow it to create a new workspace.
4. Next, update the code libraries (A.K.A. the "Learn Libraries") by [downloading the Learn libraries](http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/propeller-c/propeller-c-set-simpleide/update-your-learn-folder).
 After the download is complete, make a note of where the downloaded file is saved. Then, go back to the 
 SimpleIDE program and click
  * Tools
  * Update Workspace
  * Browse to the Learn Library file saved on your computer and click OK
