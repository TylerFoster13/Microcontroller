# UNA Summer STEM Camp 2017
## Computer Science Edition
This code repository will contain the source code and notes created during the **UNA Summer STEM Microcontroller Camp**. During this camp we will introduce computer programming in the *C Programming Language* using a microcontroller. A microcontroller is a [complete computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) with a CPU, memory, input, and output. Our microcontroller has connectors for audio, video, wireless, servo motors, power, and a serial console. We will build simple electronic circuits, employ sensors, and create code that manipulates circuits and sensors.

We will use the

* [draw.io web site](https://draw.io) to create our flowcharts,
* [SimpleIDE](http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/propeller-c/propeller-c-set-simpleide) software tool, and
* the [Activity Board WX](https://www.parallax.com/product/32912) microcontroller from Parallax.

We will build circuits with an assortment of electronic and prototyping parts such as

* LEDs,
* resistors,
* switches,
* potentiometer,
* servo motor,
* ultrasonic distance sensor,
* wireless radio,
* SD card,
* jumper wires, and a breadboard.
